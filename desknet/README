The accompanying program ("Desknet") is designed to run a network of up 
to 40 USB keyboards.  All accompanying files are released under the Gnu 
General Public License.  See file COPYING for details.

The tarball in which this file is found should be considered alpha.

This program is dependent on:
  SDL2
  SDL2-devel
  SDL2_ttf
  SDL2_ttf-devel
  FreeType

  Compiling assumes presence of gnumake and gcc compiler.

Since you are reading this, you are probably in the directory 
"desknet." If not, get there.  Enter "./configure" , then "make" and 
"make install".

The current source file is "dnet.c". The binary is dnet.  Invoke it the 
first time with the script "desknet".  Subsequently the program may be
invoked directly with "dnet".  

You will have to hand configure your keyboard network the first time
you run the program.  For instructions in how to do this type 'info 
desknet' after you install the program.

The "Check Your Work" routine requires an answer file for your textbook.  These
files are not included in this package and will need to be created by the
users for the particular books they use.  The included script "createkey" may
help create individual answer files.
