1 GETTING STARTED
*****************

What Else Do You Need?
======================

When one program relies on another program or file resource it is said
to be dependent on that resource.  The Desknet program will need you to
have installed Freetype, SDL2, SDL2-devel, SDL_ttf and SDL_ttf-devel.  I
currently use ttf-bitstream-vera-1.10, installed in
/usr/local/etc/fonts/ Other free fonts available but be sure to put them
in /usr/local/etc/fonts/ because that is where Desknet will look for
them.

Get Your Keyboards Ready
========================

I am recommending the Logitech K360 wireless keyboard for three reasons:

   1) This keyboard has no mouse and only generates 1 'event' per board,
which simplifies configuring your network.

   2) This keyboard can use the Logitech unified receiver.  Each of
these tiny receivers can distinguish 6 different keyboards.  By using
only 5 of them, I could connect up to 30 boards.

   3) Logitech claims a 3 year life from two batteries.  We shall see,
but so far it looks good.  Since each board has an on/off power switch,
this may turn out to be a credible claim.

Connect All Your System Components
==================================

One 7 port hub with 5 Logitech receivers should do the trick.  If you
plug in receivers while your computer is running, the USB system gives
each keyboard an event number, but what number it gets is pretty hard to
predict.  Even starting from scratch with all components already plugged
in will give different number assignments from one boot up to another.
Strategy here will be to start the system with everything connected, run
the 'deskplan' configuration program, and keep it all running non-stop
from September to June.  We just avoid plugging and unplugging things
during the year.

Run the 'createkey' Program
===========================

The 'createkey' script enables you to make an answer file for your
current textbook.  You probably will want to defer doing this until you
know your system is working properly.  The 'desknet' program will run
without an answer file, although the 'Check Your Math' routine will not
be available until the file is made.

   This script assumes that all the relevant pages in the text are
numbered with sequential positive integers.  If this is not the case, as
when, for example, there might be a section with Roman numerals,
letters, or decimal numbers using decimals indicating content
subsections, you will need either to leave out those pages or renumber
all the pages yourself.

   The reason for this is that this script creates a completely flat
file in which pages are marked by the character '~', problems by the
character '|', and the 'at' symbol is used to indicate the end of the
file.  When the desknet program looks up a page or problem in this file,
it simply counts the '~'s from the beginning of the file until is finds
the targeted page, then counts the '|'s until it reaches the targeted
problem.

   It should go without saying that these three symbols cannot be used
as part of an answer.  So I won't say it...

   When you run the script (with the command 'createkey' it will look in
the folder /usr/local/etc/answerkeys for any answer files that may
already be there.  You can choose which of those files to load.  But if
this is your first install, the only file there will be 'template,' so
go ahead and use that.

   Your next step is to choose 'Extend File' from the main menu.  It
will start you with page 1, problem 1.  Your choice will be to move to
page 2 (if there are no problems on page 1), to move to problem 2 (if
you don't want to have an answer to problem 1) or to enter the answer
for problem 1.  You can leave any problem answer blank, but you can not
skip a problem.

   (There will be many problems for which you will want to avoid putting
an answer.  In general they will be yes/no or multiple choice questions,
for which the kids could quickly determine the correct answer without
even reading the problem.)

   You probably will not want to make this file all in one sitting.
When you get tired, follow the directions to return to the main menu.
From that menu, use 'e - Save File'.  You will be asked for a file name.
You will probably want to use something that indicates the name of the
text, or the grade level of your class, particularly if other classes
using the network are using different grade level texts.

   When you get back to finish making the file, just run 'createkey'
again.  Your draft will be listed among the existing files, so just load
it in and continue with 'extend file.'

   When your file is finished, run both the 'Save File' and 'Install
File' routines (in that order).  'Install File' will copy your file in
your selected class folder, under the name 'key3'.  Exit the 'createkey'
script and you're ready to go.

Run the 'deskplan' Program
==========================

Each keyboard was given its own 'event number' by the USB system when
you turned on the computer.  This number lets the program identify an
input character as being from a particular keyboard.  Once it knows
which keyboard the character came from, it can figure out which display
line it should be printed on.  The 'deskplan' program asks you for an
event number and the number of a line on the screen.  There are two
columns of 'lines' on the screen, each 20 characters long.  They are
numbered from top to bottom.  On the left are lines 1 to 20; on the
right are lines 21 to 40.  When you have linked an event number and a
line number, only the keyboard that has that event number will be able
to print to that line.

   You have to know what the event numbers are.  You can find these by
typing: "nano /proc/bus/input/devices".  (No, don't type the quotation
marks.  (<: )

   A typical entry in this file looks something like this:

     I: Bus=0003 Vendor=046d Product=c52b Version=0111 N: Name="Logitech
     Unifying Device.  Wireless PID:4004" P: Phys=usb-0000:00:03.1-3.2:1
     S:
     Sysfs=/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.1/usb3/3-3/3-3.2/3-3.2:1.2/0003:
     U: Uniq= H: Handlers=sysrq kbd event11 B: PROP=0 B: EV=12001f B:
     KEY=837fff072ff32d bf54444600000000 1 30f948b17c007
     ffff73fad941dfff B: REL=40 B: ABS=100000000 B: MSC=10 B: LED=1f

   The second line shows that you are looking at a Logitech device.  If
you don't have other Logitech devices in your system, this will be one
of your keyboards.  The 6th line identifies event 11 as a keyboard.
Make a list of all the keyboard events in this file before you run
'deskplan.'  Or not.  But 'deskplan' itself will instruct you to stop
and do this if you haven't already done so.

   Once you have assigned an event number to all the boards in your
system, type "123" to leave the configuration routine.

Run the 'desknet' Program
=========================

Start the program with 'desknet'

2 STUDENT ACTIVITES
*******************

These are printed in red or green text on the main menu.  The program
presently gives the following support to teacher instruction:

Math Facts
==========

Practice for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.  This
is presented as a real-time competition.  Scoring is handicapped so that
the top students do not dominate the race.  The range of problems is
controlled by the teacher (see below) so that students are not asked to
solve problems they have not studied.

Keyboarding
===========

Touch typing, with about 160 practice lines.  Minimum standards for both
speed and accuracy must be met to advance through this material.

Guided Practice
===============

Students check their own work from the math text.  The program asks
three questions: 'What's the page?', 'What's the problem?', and 'What's
the answer?'.  It never shows the answer, and the student does not work
the problem on the computer.  It does tell the student whether she has
the right answer, thus providing immediate feedback.  It is up to the
teacher to set the rules as to what to do if the student's answer is
wrong.

Word Processing
===============

Each student has a single 20 character line in which to work.  This line
will scroll right and left, so that it will accomodate a typical
composition by elementary students.  Generally I have used it by
printing out drafts of the students' initial efforts, marking up these
hard copies, and then having the students go back and use the edit
functions to clean things up.

3 TEACHER ACTIVITIES
********************

To keep the kids from messing up the system, some of these routines ask
for a 4 digit password.  The dummy default password is 1040, which will
be familiar to Americans who pay income taxes.

Class Selection
===============

This routine is accessed from the main menu, although it does not show
on the menu screen.  The program supports up to 9 different classes.
The name of a class or group being served can be shown at the top left
of the menu.  To do this, push 'x' on the main menu.  (This function is
hidden and does not appear on the menu itself.)  Follow the screen
prompts to enter an identifier, such as "Class 1" or "Mrs.  Smith."

   To change from one class to another, go to the main menu and push a
number from 1 to 9.

Class Roster
============

This program assumes assigned seating, and thus assigned keyboards.  The
teacher will enter the names of individual students into the computer
roster, so the computer will know who is using a particular keyboard.
The roster can be viewed by pushing Q on the main menu.  It shows the
names of the students, their current typing practice lines, and their
current math handicaps (explained below).

   To enter student names into the roster, use menu item R. It will ask
you for the keyboard (line) number, and the name of the student who uses
that keyboard.

Math Facts Routines
===================

Math Facts Handicaps

   The kids are not ignorant of the fact that some are faster than
others when it comes to math.  In a competitive exercise such as this,
the danger is that one or two kids will so outclass the others that they
will always win, with the result that the rest lose interest.  To avoid
this, the facts exercises are handicapped-not everybody gets the same
number of points for a right answer.

   Here is one way to use it.  At the beginning of the school year,
everyone starts by getting 9 points for a right answer.  Make a note of
who wins the first day and set his handicap to get 8 points the next
day.  If he wins again, make it 7 points, and so on until someone else
wins.  In a few days, the program will have internalized a class
profile; this can be seen by viewing the roster as described above.
(Menu item is 'Q.')

   To change the handicaps, push H on the main menu, then enter the
student's keyboard (line) number, followed by the number of points you
want him to get.  The range is 1 to 9, but don't count on the program to
correct you if you make a mistake in the range.  You can set different
handicaps for each of the operations (addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division).

   Math Facts Win Score

   This is I on the menu, and it is pretty much self explanatory.  Range
is 1 to 99 points.  The program is not written to accomodate 3 digit
scores.

   Math Facts Problem Generation

   There is no table of problems; these are generated on the fly by the
program.  A pseudorandom number is generated for each of the two problem
terms, and the answer is then calculated for comparison with student
input.  The random number is not used directly.  Instead, it is used as
a pointer to get one of a set of 10 numbers.  The teacher has created
this set, so she is able to determine the range of possible problems.
She did this by invoking lines J and K of the menu.  Although the Menu
says multiplication, the fact is that this set of 10 numbers is used for
all the computation skills.

   Let's say that the class has studied the multiplication facts up to 3
x 9.  The teacher can push J on the menu, followed by 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3
1.  The first term of each problem will now be 1, 2, or 3.  Then, by
pushing K, followed by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1, the second term can be any
digit between 1 and 9.  Now all the problems will fall within the range
that has been previously presented to the class.

   When using menu items J or K, enter any ten digits _except zero_.

   HELP WITH CLASSWORK

   Students using this routine are getting immediate feedback as they do
textbook exercises.  But the computer merely tells them if their answer
is right or wrong.  It is up to the teacher to say what to do with that
information.  My general practice is something like this:
     First, do not do the next problem until you have the current answer
     right.  Second, if your answer is wrong,look at your work and try
     to find your mistake.  _Do not guess_.  If you can't figure out
     what you did wrong, raise your hand and ask for help.  That's what
     teachers are for, after all.

   The effect of this program varies from student to student.  For many
students, the immediate feedback by itself seems to raise interest and
effort.  Importantly, if the instructions are followed, it prevents
students from practicing an erroneous algorithm.  For example, it is
common for students at my grade level, faced with a subtraction problem
that involves borrowing, to try to take the top number from the bottom
one.  They may do several problems in a row this way, and not get
corrected until the next day after the teacher has reviewed their work.
This routine prevents that: They get corrected on the first error.

   KEYBOARDING

   My experience suggests that it's important to paint out the
alphabetical keys on the boards if you want the kids to learn to type by
touch and not hunt-and-peck.

   This program provides good practice, but it is no substitute for
instruction.  It is necessary to monitor constantly and correct the
students while they practice.

   Make sure that all the students start on the first line of the
practice set.  You can see what line each student is on by pushing menu
item Q. To change a single line (as when a student has left and another
is taking her place), use Menu item L. It will ask you for the keyboard
number and the line to start with.

   There are times when you may want to set back the entire class (such
as after a two week vacation).  To do this, use Menu item M. It sets
every student back one line, each time you push the M. This is also a
good way to quickly reset all the boards to line 1 at the beginning of
the year.

   WORD PROCESSING

   Menu item N will clear the word processor _for the entire class_.
There is no way to clear an individual student other than from his own
keyboard.

   The student types away, and when he reaches the end of the line, the
line itself scrolls to the left.  The left and right cursor keys will
function and can be used to scroll either left or right.  The keypad is
not decoded, nor is the backspace.  To erase a character, use the left
or right cursor key to land on it and then use delete.  To insert a
character, place the cursor on the character that will follow, and push
insert.  This will make a space that can then be filled with the
character you have in mind.

   The processor print routine (Menu item O) is configured for my
Brother MFC-490CW. CUPS was configured for this printer on my system, To
use another printer, it is necessary at present to change line 5009 on
the 'desknet.c' source code and then recompile the program.  This works,
but it obviously a very unsatisfactory hack, and one big 'to do' is to
find a better way.

   Two copies of each student's work are automatically saved when you
return to the main menu from menu item G. One copy will be found in
directory /usr/local/com/classX/files, as 'filea', where 'X' is the
class number and 'a' is the student's keyboard number.  This copy is
used to print out rough drafts for work in progress.

   The other copy will be found in directory /root/Documents.  The name
of this file is the student's name as you have entered it in the program
roster.  The purpose of this copy is to enable the use of a
full-featured processor, such as Open Office, to produce a polished
version of the student work.  To do this you will have to close Desknet,
open the processor, recover the student's file from /classwork, and edit
to your heart's content.  This is another deficient hack, but it works
for now.

   WARNING: If the same student name is used by more than one class,
this procedure will not distinguish the two.  The last of the two to
submit written work will have his file in /root/Documents and the
previous file will have been overwritten.  So be careful that there are
no duplicated names.

4 SYSTEM NOTES
**************

Dependencies
============

This program depends on the CUPS, SDL2, and SDL2_ttf libraries having
been installed.

What You Have Installed
=======================

If you did the standard installation with the source makefile, your
files are located in the following places (where N is a number from 1 to
9):

   /usr/local/bin/dnet the executable /usr/local/bin/desknet bash script
to configure network /usr/local/bin/createkey bash script to make
textbook answer file /usr/local/etc/events usb network configuration
/usr/local/etc/answerkeys textbook answer files
/usr/local/com/classN/names student and teacher names
/usr/local/com/classN/files student writing files
/usr/local/com/classN/names student and teacher names
/usr/local/com/classN/settings/ program parameters & student performance
/root/Downloads student writing files

Security
========

Security may or may not be a problem for you.  Minimally, you will want
to keep students from messing with the class roster, the content of the
exercises, or other students' records.  That's why you have your own
password, which you use to access some sensitive areas of the program.
The default supplied with the program is '1040,' which can be easily
remembered by its association with the federal income tax.  Of course,
as soon as some kid discovers what it is, you will have to change it.

   WARNING: As of July 2014, this routine does not include setting a
class password.  Look to the future, but for now the password for a
given class can be changed by hand.  Use your editor (I use Nano) to
look at the file /usr/local/com/classN/settings/pass (where N is the
number of the class).  Change it to whatever 4 character number you
want.  (This will not change the passwords of the other 8 classes.)
Even when the following routine is implemented, this method will be
useful when you can't get into routine X (because you have forgotten the
current password!).

   ///NOT YET IMPLEMENTED There is a hidden routine to accomplish this.
From the main menu, push X. You will be asked for your name and a
password.  The name will be displayed at the top of the menu, and the
password will allow entry into the restricted routines.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
